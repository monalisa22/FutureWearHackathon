# Smart Wear

This project aims at developing an innovative solution that uses non-invasive methods or facial reading technologies to collect health vitals and derive a fitness score that is accurate, reliable, scalable, and can be deployed in various settings, from individual homes to large healthcare organizations.The model has an accuracy of 94%.

Our solution approach is:

- Collection of health data from multiple sensors like MAX30100(heart rate sensor), accelerometer(MPU6050), ESP-32 CAM Wifi Module, blood glucose sensor and temperature sensor
- Storing data on MySQL database
- Emotion detection using Deep learning model
- Data analyis and training using several ML Algorithms
- Model Deployment 

 

 




## Optimizations
